# postfix-email-archive

Using a Postfix After-Queue Content Filter, allows an opportunity to save a copy of every email sent or received through the server.

This emerged as an alternative to spending big bucks for a Barracuda appliance. It is an effective solution for retention, compliance, and discovery. In my organization it was neccessary to meet regulatory requirements.

This solution was coupled with our proprietary web based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that allowed for easy access to archived emails throughout the organization.
